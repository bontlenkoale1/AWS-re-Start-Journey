## AWS SimuLearn: Cloud Computing Essentials ☁️

---

# Overview
In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, I reviewed a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS.

After the design is completed, I built the proposed solution through structured, step-by-step guidance in a lab within a live AWS Management Console environment.

I gained hands-on experience working with AWS services, developing job-ready competencies using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.
