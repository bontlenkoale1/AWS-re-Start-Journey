## Overview 🔍

# Simulated business scenario

The island stabilization team wanted to increase the reliability and availability of its current stabilization system.


In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, I had to review a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS.

After the design was completed, I built the proposed solution through structured, step-by-step guidance in a lab within a live AWS Management Console environment.

I gained hands-on experience working with AWS services, developing job-ready competencies using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.
