# AWS SimuLearn: File Systems in the Cloud ☁️📁
---
## Overview 📌

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** as a **fully managed, scalable cloud file system** that supports **shared access across multiple branch locations**.  
The solution enables centralized storage, real-time file sharing, and high availability using AWS managed services.

Amazon EFS provides a serverless, cloud-native file system that automatically scales, removes infrastructure management overhead, and supports distributed access for modern cloud architectures.
