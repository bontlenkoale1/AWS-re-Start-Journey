## AWS SimuLearn: Computing Solutions ☁️

---
## Overview 🔍

# Simulated business scenario

The school wants to upgrade its class scheduling system, currently running on an Amazon EC2 instance, to provide greater computing power and memory capacity.

In this AWS SimuLearn assignment, I reviewed a real-world scenario, helping a fictional customer design a solution on AWS.

After the design is completed, I had to build the proposed solution through structured, step-by-step guidance in a lab within a live AWS Management Console environment.

I gained hands-on experience working with AWS services, developing job-ready competencies using the same tools technology professionals use to construct AWS solutions.
